Patient Hub Service
The Patient Hub service is a Spring Boot application that provides CRUD operations on patient data and certain patient resources. It utilizes various features of Spring Boot and Spring Cache to achieve efficient data retrieval, configuration management, error handling, and profile-based configuration.

Features
CRUD operations on patient data.
Implementation of caching using Spring Cache for improved performance.
Externalized application properties for configuration management.
Custom exception classes for handling common scenarios like validation errors or resource not found.
Profile-based configuration for different environments (dev, qa, prod).
Minimal unit test cases to ensure the functionality of the service.
Implementation Details
CRUD Operations
The service provides the following CRUD operations on patient data:

Create: Endpoint for creating a new patient record.
Read: Endpoint for retrieving a patient record by ID.
Update: Endpoint for updating an existing patient record.
Delete: Endpoint for deleting a patient record by ID.
Caching
Caching is implemented using Spring Cache to store and retrieve patient data efficiently. The @Cacheable, @CachePut, and @CacheEvict annotations are used to cache and manage patient data.

Configuration Management
Application properties are externalized using property files or environment variables. This allows for easy configuration of database settings, cache configurations, and other application properties.

Custom Exception Handling
Custom exception classes are implemented to handle common scenarios like validation errors or resource not found. These exceptions are caught globally using @ControllerAdvice and appropriate error responses are returned.

Profile-Based Configuration
The service supports different configurations for different environments (dev, qa, prod) using Spring Boot's profile-based configuration. Separate configuration files can be used for each environment to specify environment-specific properties.

Unit Testing
Minimal unit test cases are included to ensure the functionality of the service. Mockito is used for mocking dependencies and verifying the behavior of service methods.

Getting Started
To run the Patient Hub service locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash

./mvnw spring-boot:run
Access the service endpoints at http://localhost:8090.
Configuration
Configure database settings, cache configurations, and other application properties in the application.properties or application.yml files.
Set environment-specific properties using separate configuration files for each environment (e.g., application-dev.properties, application-qa.properties, application-prod.properties).
